# 3 Token Presets

### Kaichi allows you to mint a token using a token preset that will setup you token supply and distribution parameters automatically.&#x20;

### We offer 3 types of token presets, each curated for a different use case.

To mint a token, you can navigate to your [Monetisation > Token](https://kaichi.xyz/rewards/token/start) where you can select your preferred preset: Creator, Project or Memecoin

## #1 CREATOR PRESET (Supply-controlled social token)

On Kaichi, a creator who wants to monetise his/her content becomes **a business owner.** He owns a community, and has to take good care of it. Through our intuitive tools, creators can tokenize their content, **launch supply-controlled tokens,** allowing fans to invest directly in their work and share in the financial rewards.&#x20;

Creator-tokens empower creators to become their own business owners and in a way, link the growth of their fan/audience base directly to financial benefits while ensuring a sufficient balance between creators and users.&#x20;

* In our ecosystem, **you need to earn the right to hold and spend your tokens**. Unlike traditional models where tokens are given upfront or  through a vesting schedule, and can then be dumped, **Kaichi requires you to merit your tokens** by achieving specific and objective growth metrics. This merit is earned by nurturing your community and reaching objective milestones. As a result, the focus of a creator should be on genuine engagement and growth, ensuring that his community is strong and supportive before gaining control over more of his tokens.
* **Depending on token holdings, a creator is entitled to a proportionate share of revenue**. This means that the amount of revenue (from your own content sales) you receive **is directly tied to the number of tokens you hold**. Essentially, the more tokens you own, the larger your share of the revenue generated by the platform:
  * If the creator has kept 90% of their token supply, then they will earn directly $90 for every $100 worth of sales they realize on our platform.&#x20;
    * Meanwhile, the tokens are **locked**, so the creator is entitled to the cash flow streams from sales **without being able to rug his community**.
    * This creator is signaling he believes in himself as a business owner, is going to create value, is focused on cash-flow generation, and shares 10% of it with his token holders, $KAI holders, and Kaichi protocol.
    * If the creator has kept 80% of his token supply, then he will earn directly $80 for every $100 worth of sales.&#x20;
    * Token holders, $KAI holders, and Kaichi as a protocol share up to 5% of the revenues.
  * This system incentivizes token creators and holders to acquire and hold onto tokens, as it directly impacts their potential earnings from the platform's revenue. It also makes the choice of the appropriate preset an absolute necessity.
* Anyone who believes in a specific creator's current or future success can choose to support them by purchasing their tokens, democratising crowdfunding in a way.
  * The introduction of token-based mechanisms serves as a novel means for both creators and users to directly communicate their preferences and **assign a tangible value to content, audience & growth**. Kaichi users vote for content not through abstract clicks but actual crypto, staking tokens in people and ideas they wish to see rise.&#x20;
  * It turns superficial likes/comments/shares into substantive financial endorsements, as users can directly sponsor creators by staking crypto, aka tangible value, in their success.

This is plain straight **skin-in-the-game support.**&#x20;

Users and fans can directly invest, support, and benefit from their favourite creators' growth. Simply put we’ve designed this preset so that _**“Your social capital is tokenized and represents your equity on the Solana blockchain.”**_

How the 80% locked equity will be unlocked over time will be determined once our decentralised governance has been initiated. Users themselves should have a say in this, not us. It will be based on merit and objecvtive metrics, but details are to be approved by the community.&#x20;

This preset also has a unique launch mechanism, **to prevent pump and dump schemes** and ensure a sustainable creator token launch!

#### The use cases of the Creator token in summary

Creator tokens are a type of asset that is tied to the reputation of a Kaichi account (an individual, a brand, or a community). They ensure a sufficient balance between the creator and their community and allow for revenue sharing on the revenue generated by that account to its token holders.

Creator tokens can be used for a variety of things. Some use cases might be to allow your followers to access exclusive content, to invest in you, or to simply allow your friends to speculate on your price. Some creators might sell their tokens to raise capital, while others might want to give them away as perks for certain actions.

Your token, your business, your choice!

## #2 PROJECT PRESET (for Crowdfunding)

In the project preset, the user wants to crowdfund for his idea or activity, therefore he should have direct access to most of his tokens (unlocked) so he can sell them in the pool when he needs to fundraise, or distribute them as he wishes. The token holders will also get revenue sharing from trading fees (similar to other presets).&#x20;

The newly minted tokens will be distributed in the following way: &#x20;

## #3 MEMECOIN PRESET (Supply-controlled fair launched memecoin)

Kaichi introduces here one of the most **innovative** features in the industry:&#x20;

For each memecoin launched on the platform, nearly **half of the supply will be distributed to active participants in the community helping to support and grow the memecoin's community**. These participants will be able to claim the memecoins directly in their wallet every day. The amounts will be **based on the social activity** that they do **on Kaichi** to push for the memecoin.

The other half of the supply will be put for sale in the liquidity pool (so anyone can purchase them from day 1), ensuring that the creator renounces for the profits and ownership.&#x20;

Finally, there is 4% of the supply that will be distributed to $KAI stakers in the form of a claim. The Kaichi memecoin preset positions $KAI stakers **to get lucky because by staking KAI you benefit from all other users creating popular memecoins.**&#x20;

The newly minted tokens will be distributed in the following way: &#x20;

### Cost and Starting Price

The cost to mint a creator token less than 0.033 SOL (\~$3.5), which covers the blockchain fees for both token minting and pool creation transactions.&#x20;

Every token begins with the same price of $0.00010, but the price changes depending on the supply and demand for the token. The more people buy, the more the price increases, and vice versa.&#x20;

All trading on Kaichi is non-custodial and all users always keep their funds in their wallets at all time.&#x20;
