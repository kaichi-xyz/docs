# $KAI Tokenomics

## The KAI Token

The $KAI token is the native coin of the Kaichi ecosystem. The $KAI token is a utility token that will be used for one main purpose:

Users staking $KAI tokens will receive 50% of all the revenues the platform generates from content sales or from Creator token trading.

The Kaichi token follows the SPL token standard on Solana:[ https://spl.solana.com/token](https://spl.solana.com/token)

The mint address will be published after the Token Generation Event (Q2-Q3 2024).

## $KAI Distribution

The total supply of KAI token is limited to 1 billion tokens, which are distributed as follows:

* 55% to the community to fund various airdrops, and launchpads, and to build an incentive program,
* 15% to the team, advisors & strategic partners,
* 15% for private investors,
* 15% is allocated to the strategic reserve as a buffer for a potential Serie A. If such a deal does not materialize in the near future, this allocation will be directed to the community.

## **KAI** **Emission Rate & Distribution Schedule**

The vesting schedule is as follows:&#x20;

* **Team members, advisors, and strategic partners** have two separate vesting schedules:
  1. A 3-month cliff followed by an 18-month vesting period, with monthly unlocks for 50% of their allocation.
  2. The remaining 50% of their allocation is subject to vesting based on specific milestones tied to the token's market capitalization.
     * _Incremental Release_: As the token's market capitalization increases and reaches $500 million, $1 billion, $1.5 billion, $2 billion, and $2.5 billion, 2% (by tranche) of the allocated tokens automatically vest and become available. &#x20;
     * _Incentivizing Growth:_ This approach incentivizes the team to contribute to the growth and success of the project. As the project becomes more successful and the token's market capitalization increases, the team receives a larger portion of their allocated tokens. &#x20;
     * _Alignment of Interests_: Tying the vesting to market capitalization aligns the interests of the team, and current token holders with the overall success and adoption of the project. The team stays fully motivated to contribute to activities that drive up the value of the token since it directly impacts the unlocking of their vested tokens. &#x20;
* **Alpha Round Investors** have a 3-month cliff and 9-month vesting with monthly unlocks.
* **Private Round Investors** have no cliff and a 6-month vesting period with monthly unlocks.
* **Public Round Investors** have no cliff and no vesting.
* **A strategic reserve** is unlocked and will be either kept for Serie A as a buffer, or distributed to the community.
