# Business Model & Revenue Sharing

> "When a creator earns revenue from content sales or token trading, Kaichi also reaps the benefits. Subsequently, Kaichi redistributes this income toward all KAI stakers, in addition to the token holders of the respective creator!"

_Let’s take a closer look at how we generate revenue, share revenue and how this is a profitable business model for all stakeholders: the creator, the follower, and Kaichi._

Both as a platform and as crypto natives, we have found that revenue sharing is one of the best practices to attract and maintain users in web3.. Here is a breakdown of what an average Kaichi user can expect to earn from Kaichi’s revenue sharing program.

**First off, there are multiple revenue streams**&#x20;

* Paid posts fee: Kaichi charges a 5% fee on any content that is paid for. This is when a user pays to unlock a hidden post. Fifty percent of this fee is shared with Kaichi token stakeholders, the other 50% goes to the Kaichi Vault.
* Subscription fee: Kaichi charges a 5% fee on all subscriptions. This is when a user subscribes to a creator’s content. Fifty percent of this fee is shared with Kaichi token stakeholders (on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis), the other 50% goes to the Kaichi Vault.
* Trading fee: Kaichi charges a 5% fee on all trades on the platform. This is when a user buys or sells a Creator or Project token. Fifty percent of this fee is shared with Kaichi token stakeholders, an additional 25% of this fee is given to holders of that Creator/Project token, the other 25% goes to the Kaichi Vault.
* Tipping fee: Kaichi charges a flat fee of $0.10 on each tip on the platform.

Example: Bob token generates $100,000 in trading fees for the Kaichi platform. Kaichi token stakers and Bob token holders would receive $50,000 (for stakers) and $25,000 for the Bob holders.
{% endhint %}

**In summary:**

* Kaichi charges 5% fees on paid content and on trading.
* Revenues from fees are always paid in USDC to the KAI stakers & to the token holders of the creator token, project token or memecoin.
* $KAI holders always earn 50% of all the fees the platform generates.

## **Our Revenue Sharing Business Model**

Once creators generate revenue, Kaichi distributes this revenue to the holders of the creator tokens (or memecoins or project tokens) and to the KAI stakers, who can claim these revenues in USDC every day directly in their wallets.
