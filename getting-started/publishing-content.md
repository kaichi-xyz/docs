# Publishing Content

To publish content on Kaichi you can have the option to **select various levels of privacy and monetization:**&#x20;

* **Public posts** are free to view, and public to anyone.
* **Paid posts** can be viewed only to people that either:
  * Make a **one-time payment** (for example $2 USDC to access a single post), called **Pay-per-View**.
  * **Subscribe** to you (for example $29/month). Subscribers can always view all your paid posts.

The images and videos are uploaded on the IPFS network when you make a post. The videos are also encoded directly on the client-side (on your computer), to ensure that they are not modified or altered by anyone.

Text posts can be published on the Solana blockchain itself (to ensure maximum censorship resistance), however this has a cost to the user (in SOL, for the blockchain transaction fee). The exact cost depends on the size of the content you're posting. The longer the text, the more expensive the cost.
