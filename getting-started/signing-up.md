# Signing up

To create a new account on Kaichi, you only need to provide a username (the avatar, display name, and email address are optional). We create your account on the Solana blockchain, and give you the seed phrase of your wallet (if you create a Kaichi wallet, which is the default way).&#x20;

Otherwise, if you signup with your own Solana wallet, you need to sign with your existing Solana wallet (such as [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Solflare](https://solflare.com/), [Backpack](https://backpack.app/), etc) to validate your account creation.&#x20;

You can customize your profile with additional information to share with your followers.

**A wallet is all it takes to participate:** No email, no phone number, no permissions required! Full-on web3.&#x20;
