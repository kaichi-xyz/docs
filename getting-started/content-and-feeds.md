# Content & Feeds

On Kaichi, you have the flexibility to create various types of posts such as text-based entries, images, videos, posts with polls, and extensive articles that can incorporate all these elements in a single post.

All media content on Kaichi is hosted on IPFS, and text-based content can also be published directly on the Solana blockchain.&#x20;

### Types of posts on Kaichi

On Kaichi, you have the flexibility to create various types of posts, such as text-based entries, images, videos, posts with polls, and extensive articles that can incorporate all these elements in a single post.

#### Posts with images

You can attach up to 10 images to every post. You can also add inline images inside of your posts. You can use our [Markdown Guidelines](markdown-guidelines.md) to learn how to do this.&#x20;

#### Posts with videos&#x20;

Anyone can post videos that are limited for now of max 10 minutes long, and max 10 videos per user per hour.&#x20;

All the encoding and compressing are done in a decentralized way on your local devices directly. This system makes sure the content is not altered by the platform.&#x20;

To give some stats about the speed, the compression is running at about:

• 2x for a video of 576p 25fps (so a 10min video will take 5min to encode and compress)

• 1x for a video of 720p 25fps (so a 10min video will take 10min to encode and compress)

• 0.5x for a video of 1080p 25fps (so a 10min video will take 20min to encode and compress)

• 0.24x for a video of 1080p 60fps (so a 10min video will take 40min to encode and compress)

#### Articles

You can post long articles, similar to Medium or Substack, with full markdown editing, in-line images, etc. You can check the [Markdown Guidelines guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to learn how you can format your articles. Articles are not limited in size so you can make them as long as you need.

#### Publishing Content on the Solana Blockchain

To post content onchain, you can tick the "Post on Solana" box in the posting menu. You'll be guided and have an estimated price for the transaction fee to pay (depending on the size of your content), then you can sign a transaction (if you're logged-in with an external wallet), or click on "Confirm" directly to post the content onchain.&#x20;

The page may reload to display the post properly, with the link to the blockchain explorer corresponding to your post.

#### NSFW Posts (Not-Safe-For-Work)&#x20;

You can use the NSFW button to blur images that you think may be inappropriate for particular users.



### Kaichi Feeds

On Kaichi, content is displayed in Feeds, of which there are two types: the Discover Feed and My Feed.

* **The Discover Feed** showcases posts from all users, with the most trending content initially appearing at the top of this feed.
* **My Feed**, on the other hand, is your landing page. It is a personalised feed where you can view posts from users you follow in an historical order only (this feed isn't altered by any sort of algorithm, only showing the posts of people you follow in the order in which they are posted).

#### Trending Posts

* Gaining visibility through trending posts on Kaichi can significantly boost your follower count, token ownership, and overall audience growth. &#x20;
* To have your post appear in the trending category, focus on creating content that resonates and engages your audience. If you're new and don't yet have an audience, consider connecting with existing Kaichi users by engaging with their content.&#x20;
* You can invite them to check out your page, invest in your token, and establish a connection with you. Our internal algorithm not only filters for genuine trending posts (beyond mere spam likes) but also encourages experimentation with your posts. While trending is an effective way to expand your audience, it's not the only method, but it certainly is beneficial.
* The ranking of posts in the trending section is influenced by the level of activity they receive, including upvotes, reposts, and comments.

#### Posts Filter System&#x20;

* All public posts are also organised by topics, and languages (powered by AI) with improved Filters on the Discover Page. &#x20;
* This allows you to refine your searches and easily find the content that interests you the most.&#x20;
* Not only you can sort by Trending, Newest, and Most Upvoted posts. We've expanded the sorting functionality to include popular Languages (with a promise to widen this list over time) and popular Categories.
