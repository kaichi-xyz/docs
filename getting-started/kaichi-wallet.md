# Kaichi Wallet

The Kaichi wallet is a non-custodial wallet that allows for seamless usage within the platform and enables transfers to any Solana wallet.&#x20;

One of its key benefits is the convenience it offers, as it eliminates the need for signing each transaction, a requirement when using external Solana wallets.

Upon creating an account with a Kaichi wallet, users are given a seed phrase. This phrase not only facilitates account access but also allows for the transfer of the Kaichi wallet to other Solana wallets (for example importing your Kaichi wallet to Phantom or Solflare). It's important to note that we do not store your seed phrase, only you have access to your seed phrase or your private key.

To back up your Kaichi wallet by obtaining your seed phrase and private key, navigate to "Settings," then select "Privacy and Security," and finally choose "Seed Phrase Backup".

Kaichi wallets are non-custodial: Our users have complete control over their assets and their private keys.&#x20;

This means that a user is responsible for securing their cryptocurrency and ensuring that their private keys or seed phrase are safe.&#x20;

### How to export your Kaichi wallet to Phantom or Solflare

Users can also export their Kaichi wallet to another wallet provider if they wish, for that they can visit Settings > Privacy & Security > Seedphrase Back-up: [https://kaichi.xyz/settings/security](https://kaichi.xyz/settings/security)

Then copy their private key, and go to Phantom (or any other Solana wallet), and import a new wallet using the private key.&#x20;

All your crypto and user tokens will be there, with their names and avatars!
