# Creating your Token

On Kaichi, users have the opportunity to launch their own token, with [3 different presets: creator, project or memecoins.](../essentials/3-token-presets.md)

If you are ready to monetize your content, go to **Monetization > Create my Token.** Kaichi will automatically mint you a billion user tokens, allocate them in various buckets according to the preset you previously opted for, and create your token trading pool.

And remember that all users that hold your token have **access to a private group** chat with you, and fellow token holders.

All user tokens are standard [SPL tokens on Solana ](https://spl.solana.com/token)and are **inter-operable** across the whole Solana ecosystem. Your personal user tokens represent your own social market cap, and people who are interested in you for whatever reason might be interested in investing in your token.&#x20;

**Each user always has 1 billion tokens minted, and the initial price of a user token is $0.00010 for everyone.**
