# Competitor Analysis

If you're a content creator, Kaichi is the most cost effective solution to monetize your content.&#x20;

Here is a breakdown comparison of the commission rates across various platforms (most of them don't even have a social network associated with their platform):&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="297">Content Creator Platforms</th><th>Commission Fees on Content Sales</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kaichi</td><td><a href="broken-reference">5%</a></td></tr><tr><td>YouTube</td><td><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72902?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhats-my-revenue-share">45% to 55%</a></td></tr><tr><td>Patreon</td><td><a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/11111747095181-Creator-fees-overview">8% to 12%</a></td></tr><tr><td>OnlyFans</td><td><a href="https://onlyfans.com/help/3/120/129">20%</a></td></tr><tr><td>Fansly</td><td><a href="https://fansly.com/application">20% </a></td></tr><tr><td>Substack</td><td><a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037607131-How-much-does-Substack-cost">10%</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

**All these platform also charge an extra 2.9% fee on credit card payments.** \
\
But because Kaichi is using Solana, you pay no additional fee to receive the payments for your content sales, only a blockchain transfer of 0.000005 SOL (about $0.0007 USD).&#x20;
