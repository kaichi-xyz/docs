# Download Apps

Please find below the different ways to install our app on your phone. The reason why we recommend PWA or APK apps is that Apple or Google could censor some of our features (they have in the past, and could do so again in the future), and restrict you from using Kaichi to its full potential. The PWA and APK methods effectively bypass the app stores censorship, and allow you to install any software you want on your phone (as you should).
