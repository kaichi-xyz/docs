# Introduction

TL;DR: here is a 30sec video giving a high level overview of Kaichi:&#x20;

At Kaichi, we build tools that enable everyone to effortlessly take part in the new economy - an economy driven by tokenization and financialization, where decentralisation and digital ownership prevail.&#x20;

Social consensus, traditionally shaped on web2 platforms by a complex interplay of algorithmic decisions and user interactions, is at Kaichi influenced directly by market forces. Unlike conventional social networks that primarily focus on user engagement metrics, Kaichi introduces a dynamic marketplace where users actively participate in determining the value of content through the exchange of tokens.&#x20;

The market-driven social consensus on Kaichi transforms the platform into a dynamic marketplace of ideas and content.&#x20;

Furthermore, **we align financial incentives between creators and social media platforms**, and offer a fair governance framework as well as a censorship resistant environment for content creation. Key to understanding Kaichi is to consider it a free-market platform.&#x20;

Users can for example:

1. **Tokenise their social capital** by creating their own **supply-controlled token** and monetising their content.&#x20;
2. **Invest in the upside and growth of their favorite creators** by buying and selling the creator’s token depending on how much value the creator provides.
3. **Earn a share of the platform’s revenue** as a consistent cash flow stream from the fees that Kaichi earns, and also from the earnings of each tokens and memecoins that you hold.

With a decade of trading experience and backgrounds in traditional finance, the founders of Kaichi were clear in their design for the token stack: **transform creator tokens from pump-and-dump schemes into sustainable tokenized models** where both the creator, the token buyer (e.g., follower) and the platform benefit.

The solution is two-fold:

1. **Three token launch presets** are curated to cater to the needs of the creator, brand, or meme coin community. Each preset has its own distribution and, more importantly, its launch mechanism (market making). This guarantees a sustainable bootstrap phase for your token.
2. A **revenue-sharing model** is integrated into all transactions on the platform, powered by the platform's native token, $KAI.
